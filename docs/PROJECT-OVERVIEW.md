# Project Overview

## What We Have Now (August 2025)

This trading bot project is currently a **sophisticated real-time market data visualization dashboard** with solid trading bot infrastructure, but it cannot actually trade yet.

### ✅ Working Features

**Real-Time Market Dashboard**:

- Professional TradingView-style charts built with D3.js
- Live BTC/USDT price data streaming via CCXT Pro WebSocket
- Multi-panel chart layout (price, volume, oscillators)
- Interactive charts with zoom, pan, and auto-scaling
- Responsive design that works on all devices

**Strategy Management Interface**:

- Create, edit, and delete trading strategies via UI
- JSON-based strategy storage system
- Visual strategy builder interface
- Strategy selection and configuration

**Technical Infrastructure**:

- Modern React/TypeScript frontend
- Express/TypeScript backend with clean API structure
- WebSocket-only data architecture (1000+ candles + real-time)
- File-based storage ready for database migration

### ❌ Missing Core Features

**Trading Bot Functionality**:

- No strategy execution engine (strategies don't run)
- No real-time indicator calculations
- No buy/sell signal generation
- No order placement or position management
- No performance tracking or P&L calculations

**Bottom Line**: Beautiful data visualization, but it can't trade.

## What We Need to Build

### Priority 1: Strategy Execution Engine

Implement the core logic to:

- Calculate indicators in real-time (RSI, MACD, EMA, etc.)
- Generate buy/sell signals based on strategy configuration
- Process OHLCV data through strategy algorithms

### Priority 2: Trading Integration

Connect to actual trading:

- Place orders through CCXT when signals are generated
- Monitor positions and manage portfolio
- Handle order status and execution updates

### Priority 3: Performance System

Track trading results:

- Log all trades with timestamps and prices
- Calculate profit/loss in real-time
- Display performance metrics on dashboard

## How to Get Started

### For Developers

1. **Clone and run**: `npm install && npm run dev`
2. **See live charts**: Open `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Focus on backend**: Frontend is production-ready
4. **Start with**: `local_modules/utils/strategy-engine.ts`

### For Testing

- Charts and data streaming work immediately
- Strategy UI is functional (display only)
- WebSocket connection shows "Connected"
- All infrastructure is stable and ready

## Key Files to Understand

### Frontend (Working)

- `src/components/TradingViewChart.tsx` - Professional D3.js charts
- `src/hooks/useWebSocket.tsx` - Real-time data streaming
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Main application interface

### Backend (Needs Implementation)

- `local_modules/utils/strategy-engine.ts` - Core strategy execution (framework only)
- `local_modules/utils/strategyIndicators.ts` - Indicator calculations (basic only)
- `local_modules/routes/apiRoutes/routes-trading.ts` - Trading endpoints (empty)

### Configuration

- `local_modules/db/strategies/` - JSON strategy definitions
- `local_modules/db/indicators/` - Indicator metadata
- `.env` - Binance API credentials

## Technology Used

**Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, D3.js, TailwindCSS  
**Backend**: Express, CCXT Pro, WebSocket, Technical Indicators library  
**Data**: WebSocket streaming, File-based JSON storage

## What Makes This Special

1. **Professional-grade charting** with TradingView-style interface
2. **Real-time data streaming** with 1000+ historical candles
3. **Clean architecture** ready for trading bot development
4. **Type-safe throughout** with comprehensive TypeScript
5. **WebSocket-only data model** for consistent real-time updates

## Current Demo

Run `npm run dev` and you'll see:

- Live BTC/USDT candlestick charts updating in real-time
- Professional multi-panel layout with price and volume
- Strategy management interface (UI only)
- Responsive design that works beautifully

**What's missing**: The charts look great, but no actual trading happens.

## Next Steps

The foundation is excellent. Focus development on:

1. **Strategy execution engine** - make strategies actually run
2. **Trading integration** - connect to real order placement
3. **Performance tracking** - log and analyze trading results

With these three components, this becomes a fully functional trading bot.
