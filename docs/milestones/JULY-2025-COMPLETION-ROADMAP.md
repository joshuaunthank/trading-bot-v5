# Trading Bot System Completion Roadmap - July 2025

## Current State Assessment ‚úÖ

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Data Dashboard** - Professional Chart.js visualization
- ‚úÖ **WebSocket Infrastructure** - Stable CCXT Pro streaming (1000 candles + live)
- ‚úÖ **Modern Frontend** - React/TypeScript component architecture
- ‚úÖ **API Route Structure** - RESTful endpoints with domain separation
- ‚úÖ **File-based Data Management** - JSON strategies and indicators

### Critical Gaps Identified
- ‚ùå **Strategy Schema Compliance** - Current files violate schema, will break system
- ‚ùå **Backend Indicator Calculations** - Frontend does local calc instead of backend
- ‚ùå **Actual Trading Functions** - No order execution or position management
- ‚ùå **ML Models & Postprocessing** - Schema fields exist but no implementation
- ‚ùå **Risk Management** - No stop-loss, position sizing, or risk controls

## Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Week 1) üö®

### Priority 1A: Schema Compliance (URGENT)
- **Run strategy migration script** to fix schema violations
- **Update strategy creation/edit modal** to support all schema fields
- **Add validation** for strategy files on load

### Priority 1B: Backend Indicator Streaming
- **Implement `alignIndicatorData`** utility in backend
- **Update WebSocket server** to calculate and stream indicators per strategy
- **Remove frontend local calculations** to establish single source of truth

### Priority 1C: Strategy-Based Data Flow
- **Frontend strategy selection** triggers backend indicator calculations
- **WebSocket subscription** includes strategy ID for personalized indicators
- **Chart overlays** sourced from backend, not local calculations

## Phase 2: Trading Engine (Week 2) üí∞

### Priority 2A: Order Execution
- **Implement actual trading functions** using CCXT
- **Add order placement endpoints** (market, limit, stop orders)
- **Position monitoring** and real-time updates

### Priority 2B: Risk Management
- **Stop-loss implementation** with configurable percentages
- **Position sizing** based on risk management rules
- **Portfolio limits** and exposure controls

### Priority 2C: Strategy Execution
- **Signal generation** from indicator calculations
- **Automated trading** based on strategy signals
- **Manual override controls** for safety

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3) üìä

### Priority 3A: ML Models Support
- **Schema implementation** for ML model configuration
- **Model training endpoints** for strategy optimization
- **Prediction integration** with trading signals

### Priority 3B: Postprocessing Pipeline
- **Signal filtering** and confirmation logic
- **Multi-timeframe analysis** support
- **Custom postprocessing rules** per strategy

### Priority 3C: Performance Analytics
- **Backtesting engine** with historical data
- **Strategy performance tracking** and comparison
- **Risk-adjusted returns** and drawdown analysis

## Phase 4: Production Features (Week 4) üè≠

### Priority 4A: User Management
- **Authentication system** for secure access
- **API key management** with encryption
- **Multi-user support** with isolated strategies

### Priority 4B: Advanced UI
- **Complete strategy builder** with visual editor
- **Advanced chart overlays** with indicator customization
- **Real-time performance dashboard** with alerts

### Priority 4C: Deployment & Monitoring
- **Production deployment** configuration
- **System monitoring** and health checks
- **Automated testing** and CI/CD pipeline
