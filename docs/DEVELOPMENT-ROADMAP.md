- [ ] Strategies can be started and generate real signals
- [ ] Indicators calculate and update in real-time
- [ ] Charts show live strategy signals and indicator values
- [ ] Strategy performance metrics are tracked

### **Phase 2 Complete When:**

- [ ] Strategies can place actual buy/sell orders

## üí° **Development Approach**

1. **Start Small**: Implement one indicator calculation (RSI) first
2. **Test Continuously**: Verify each feature before moving to next
3. **Build Incrementally**: Add features one at a time
4. **Document Progress**: Update status after each milestone
5. **Maintain Quality**: Keep code clean and well-tested

**The foundation is excellent. Now we need to build the actual trading bot functionality on top of it.**
