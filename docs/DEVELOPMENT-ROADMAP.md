- [ ] Add signal generation logic based on strategy JSON configuration
- [ ] Build event-driven strategy processing with WebSocket integration
- [ ] Connect calculated indicators to chart overlays
- [ ] Add strategy state management (running/stopped/paused)

**Key Files to Modify**:

- `local_modules/utils/strategy-engine.ts` - Core execution logic
- `local_modules/utils/strategyIndicators.ts` - Indicator calculations
- `local_modules/routes/api-utils/strategy-execution-websocket.ts` - API integration

### 1.2 Trading Integration

**Status**: 0% complete  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies**: CCXT Pro (already included)

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement order placement using CCXT trading functions
- [ ] Add position management and tracking
- [ ] Build real-time portfolio updates
- [ ] Add risk management (stop-loss, take-profit)
- [ ] Implement order status monitoring

**Key Files to Create/Modify**:

- `local_modules/utils/trading-engine.ts` - New file for trading logic
- `local_modules/routes/apiRoutes/routes-trading.ts` - Uncomment and implement
- `local_modules/types/trading.ts` - New file for trading types

### 1.3 Performance Tracking System

**Status**: 5% complete (structure only)  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Dependencies**: File system or database

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement trade logging and storage
- [ ] Add P&L calculations
- [ ] Build real-time performance metrics
- [ ] Add performance visualization to frontend
- [ ] Implement trade history tracking

**Key Files to Modify**:

- `local_modules/routes/api-utils/performance-tracking-websocket.ts` - Implement actual tracking
- `src/components/tabs/TestingTab.tsx` - Add performance display
- `local_modules/db/trades/` - New directory for trade storage

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (Priority 2)

### 2.1 Risk Management System

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Advanced position sizing algorithms
- [ ] Portfolio-level risk controls
- [ ] Drawdown protection
- [ ] Volatility-based adjustments

### 2.2 Multi-Strategy Engine

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Concurrent strategy execution
- [ ] Portfolio allocation between strategies
- [ ] Strategy performance comparison
- [ ] Resource management for multiple strategies

### 2.3 Backtesting Engine

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Historical data processing
- [ ] Strategy optimization
- [ ] Walk-forward analysis
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulations

## Phase 3: Production Features (Priority 3)

### 3.1 Database Integration

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Replace file-based storage with PostgreSQL
- [ ] Implement data migrations
- [ ] Add connection pooling
- [ ] Optimize query performance

### 3.2 User Management & Security

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

**Tasks**:

- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Secure API key management
- [ ] Role-based permissions
- [ ] Audit logging

### 3.3 Deployment & Monitoring

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Production deployment setup
- [ ] Application monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1-2: Strategy Execution Foundation

1. Start with simple indicator calculations (SMA, EMA)
2. Implement basic signal generation
3. Connect to existing WebSocket infrastructure
4. Test with paper trading first

### Week 3-4: Trading Integration

1. Implement CCXT order placement
2. Add position tracking
3. Build risk management controls
4. Test with small positions

### Week 5-6: Performance & Polish

1. Add comprehensive logging
2. Build performance dashboard
3. Implement backtesting
4. Add error handling and recovery

## Technical Approach

### Strategy Execution Pattern

```typescript
// Event-driven processing
websocket.onOHLCVUpdate((data) => {
	strategies.forEach((strategy) => {
		const indicators = calculateIndicators(strategy, data);
		const signals = generateSignals(strategy, indicators);
		if (signals.length > 0) {
			executeTrade(signals);
		}
	});
});
```

### Data Flow Architecture

```
WebSocket OHLCV → Strategy Engine → Signal Generation → Trading Engine → Performance Tracking
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete When:

- [ ] Strategies can calculate indicators in real-time
- [ ] Buy/sell signals are generated correctly
- [ ] Orders are placed and tracked
- [ ] Basic P&L is calculated
- [ ] All functionality works with live data

### Phase 2 Complete When:

- [ ] Multiple strategies run concurrently
- [ ] Advanced risk management is active
- [ ] Backtesting produces reliable results
- [ ] Performance optimization is implemented

### Phase 3 Complete When:
