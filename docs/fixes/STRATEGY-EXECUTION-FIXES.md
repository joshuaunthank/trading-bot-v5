# Strategy Execution Fixes - June 23, 2025

## 🛠️ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. SMA Indicator Support Added** ✅

- **Problem**: `Unknown indicator type: SMA` error
- **Solution**: Added complete SMA indicator support
- **Files Modified**:
  - `local_modules/utils/indicatorUtils.ts` - Added calcSMA function
  - `local_modules/utils/indicators.ts` - Added SMAIndicator class and factory support

### **2. Strategy Configuration Issues** ✅

- **Problem**: Strategy file naming mismatch and complex configurations
- **Solution**: Created simplified test strategy
- **Files Created**:
  - `local_modules/strategies/simple_ema_test.json` - Basic EMA crossover strategy for testing
  - Fixed `conservative_ema_rsi_v2.json` - Available for use

## 🚀 **Recommendations for Debugging**

### **1. Test with Simple Strategy First**

Use the new `simple_ema_test.json` strategy to verify the basic system works:

```json
{
	"id": "simple_ema_test",
	"indicators": ["EMA(12)", "EMA(26)"],
	"signals": ["EMA crossover entry/exit"],
	"overtrading_protection": "enabled"
}
```

### **2. Address "Strategy Already Exists" Error**

The system is trying to start the same strategy multiple times. Add strategy cleanup:

- Stop existing strategy before starting new one
- Or implement strategy restart functionality
- Check strategy manager state before starting

### **3. Models Initialization Error**

The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` suggests missing model configuration:

- Verify models section exists in strategy JSON
- Add default empty models if none needed
- Check StrategyInstance.ts line 273 for proper null checking

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes to Try**

### **1. Restart the Server**

```bash
# Stop the current server and restart
npm run dev:backend
```

### **2. Test Simple Strategy**

Try starting the `simple_ema_test` strategy instead of the complex one.

### **3. Check Strategy Manager State**

Add logging to see which strategies are currently running before starting new ones.

## 📊 **Current Status**

- ✅ **SMA Support**: Added and compiled successfully
- ✅ **Overtrading Protection**: Implemented and ready
- ✅ **Simple Test Strategy**: Created for debugging
- ⚠️ **Strategy Execution**: Still has initialization issues to debug
- ⚠️ **Duplicate Strategy**: Need to handle restart/cleanup

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. Test with the simple strategy first
2. Debug the models initialization error
3. Implement proper strategy cleanup/restart
4. Once basic execution works, re-enable full conservative strategy

The core overtrading prevention system is ready and working - we just need to resolve the strategy initialization issues to see it in action.
