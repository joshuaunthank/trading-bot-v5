# Documentation Status - June 26, 2025

## üö® **DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP NOTICE**

**This document tracks the status of project documentation to prevent confusion about actual vs claimed progress.**

---

## ‚úÖ **ACCURATE DOCUMENTATION**

### **Current Status (Truthful)**

- `docs/ACTUAL-PROJECT-STATUS.md` - Honest assessment of what works vs what doesn't ‚úÖ
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md` - Realistic implementation plan ‚úÖ
- `docs/fixes/LIVE-CHART-UPDATES-FIX-JUNE-26-2025.md` - Recent fixes ‚úÖ

### **Architecture Documentation (Accurate)**

- WebSocket implementation details and fixes are accurate
- Frontend chart functionality documentation is correct
- Backend API structure documentation reflects file system reality

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISLEADING/OUTDATED DOCUMENTATION**

### **Milestone Documents (Overstated Claims)**

**Status: MISLEADING - Claims completion of features that don't exist**

- `API-MODERNIZATION-COMPLETE-JUNE-25-2025.md` ‚ùå

  - **Claims**: "Complete API Implementation"
  - **Reality**: API routes exist but most endpoints return placeholders

- `PHASE-2-COMPLETE-REAL-INDICATORS-SIGNALS.md` ‚ùå

  - **Claims**: "Real indicators and signals complete"
  - **Reality**: No real indicator calculations or signal generation

- `STRATEGY-CHART-INTEGRATION-COMPLETE.md` ‚ùå

  - **Claims**: "Strategy execution integrated with charts"
  - **Reality**: Only visual display, no strategy execution backend

- `CHART-OVERLAY-MILESTONE-COMPLETE.md` ‚ùå
  - **Claims**: "Chart overlays with live strategy data"
  - **Reality**: Static indicator overlays only

### **Status Documents (Outdated Claims)**

**Status: OUTDATED - Based on planned features, not actual implementation**

- `CURRENT-STATUS-SUMMARY.md` ‚ùå
- `CURRENT-STATUS-JUNE-24-2025.md` ‚ùå
- `CURRENT-STATE-ANALYSIS-JUNE-25-2025.md` ‚ùå

These documents claim production-ready status and complete functionality that doesn't exist.

## üîß **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

### **For Developers Reading This Project**

1. **Primary Reference**: Use `docs/ACTUAL-PROJECT-STATUS.md` for accurate status
2. **Development Plan**: Follow `docs/DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md` for implementation
3. **Ignore Misleading Claims**: Milestone documents overstated progress significantly
4. **Test Reality**: Run the project to see what actually works vs what's claimed

### **Documentation Cleanup Plan**

1. **Create Archive**: Move misleading docs to `docs/archive/` folder
2. **Update Index**: Maintain this status document as primary reference
3. **Future Standards**: Only document features after they're actually implemented
4. **Reality Checks**: Verify all claims against actual code functionality

## üìä **DOCUMENTATION ACCURACY SCALE**

### **‚úÖ Accurate (Use These)**

- Real-time data streaming documentation
- Frontend chart functionality
- WebSocket implementation details
- Project structure and setup guides

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Accurate (Use With Caution)**

- API route structure (routes exist, logic doesn't)
- Strategy file format (files exist, execution doesn't)
- Architecture overview (foundation accurate, features overstated)

### **‚ùå Misleading (Ignore These)**

- Any claims of "production ready"
- "Complete" API implementation
- Strategy execution functionality
- Trading bot capabilities
- Performance analytics
- Backtesting systems

## üí° **LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Document After Implementation**: Don't document planned features as complete
2. **Regular Reality Checks**: Verify documentation matches actual functionality
3. **Honest Assessment**: Better to under-promise and over-deliver
4. **Clear Status Indicators**: Use clear markers for planned vs implemented features

---

**Bottom Line: The project has excellent foundational work, but previous documentation significantly overstated completion status. Use the accurate documentation listed above for development decisions.**
